# ðŸ”¤ Next Word Prediction using LSTM with Streamlit

This project is an NLP application that uses a trained **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network to predict the **next word** in a given sequence of text. It includes a **Streamlit web interface** for real-time interaction.

## ðŸš€ Demo

ðŸ“¥ Input: `To be or not to`  
ðŸ”® Next Word PRediction: `in't`

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- ðŸ”¡ Predicts the next word in a sentence using LSTM
- ðŸ§  Trained on Shakespearean-style text (or any corpus of your choice)
- ðŸ§ª Real-time word prediction via a simple Streamlit UI
- ðŸ“Š Displays predicted word

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pickle
- Streamlit
- LSTM model (Trained using Tokenizer & Sequential input text)

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. User enters a partial sentence (e.g., "to be or not to")
2. The text is tokenized using a pre-trained tokenizer
3. Sequence is padded and passed into the LSTM model
4. The model predicts the most probable next word
5. The predicted word is shown in the UI
